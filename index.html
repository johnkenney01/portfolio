                <h4>Scope:</h4>
                <p>As part of my visual Programming class we had to use a REST API and create a java application using the netbeans IDE. I chose to make an information database like application for the popular FPS (First Person Shooter)
                 Valorant. The goal was to provide the user with a indepth look into all the games elements including characters & their abilties, maps and their unique distinctions, the guns & classes, & an interactive team builder feature.</p>
                <h4>Features:</h4>
                <li>Multiple Windows, broken down by game elements.</li>
                <li>Multi threading for fast and seamless response time.</li>
                <li>Save feature from team builder page, allows user to save team locally to device.</li>

                <h2>Endless Wave Based 2D Survival Video Game</h2>
                <h4>Scope:</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my semester long project for my Programming for Games & Interactive Technologies class. We learned many concepts and 
                    techniques related to game dev and were to progressively create a game throughout the course of the semester applying what we learned.
                    We used the Love2D framework and LUA as the programming language.
                </p>
                <h4>Details:</h4>
                <p>
                    For my game I decided to go with a top down 2d wave based survival game. The idea was the user would play and endless waves of enemies would be 
                    swarming to the player and the goal of the player was to fight off these enemies for as long as they could.I used free assets from itch.io and 
                    was actually able to create and implement my own hitbox algorithm which I was excited about showcasing. I was also able to implement a relatively 
                    smart AI movement system where the enemies would actually go towards the player rather than just moving back and forth which was another huge feature of the game.
                    The game included a splash screen, outro screen, in game sounds, a pause menu and a score board.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h4>Sports</h4>
            <p>I have a variety of sports throughout my life including football, track, wrestling, lacrosse, baseball, and soccer. I mainly focused on football as I was able to play colligate Football at my alma mater Endicott College. 
                Here I was able to be a 4 year starter at running back where I went on to win a CCC (Commonwealth Coast Conference) Championship and became a team captain my senior year. I throughly enjoy watching football, mainly the 
                NFL where I am a die hard Dallas Cowboys fan. I am a passionate fantasy football player as well having played every year since I started watching the game. I have learned a lot of life skills that have translated to other aspects 
                of my life than simply on the field. I have learned through years of atheltics the meaning of teamwork, cooperation, communication, and leadership, skills I do not think I would have developed otherwise. 
            </p>
            <h4>Jounrey To Computer Science</h4>
            <p>A question I am often asked as a computer science major is "What made you get into CS?". You see I entered college as a sport management major, not really knowing what I wanted to do 
                I thought since my life had always revolved around sports that sport management was a safe option. After going a year and a half through the Sport Management Program and a half completed minor in communications I realized that
                sport management was not the path for. I have always been somewhat tech savy and an avid video gamer, I vividly remember playing Red Dead Redemption 2 whilst being in the middle of my winter break sophomore year of college rethinking my major...I 
                though to myself, "I wonder how a video games are made, I want to know everything that goes into making such a game." This led me to look more into CS and before the start of the 2nd semester of my sophomore year I was a CS major starting my first 
                intro to programming class.
            </p>
            <p> 
                It was not a smooth transition for me. I really had no idea what I was really getting into. I had no prior experience with programming
                and was very much introduced to CS like a rookie being welcomed into the NFL with a devestating hit. Coincidentatly this was also the same year Covid 19 broke out and we were 
                sent home about a month into the semester. This was really tough for me as I was transitioning into a major and into a realm in which I had never been in before and on top of that
                I am sitting in my room now attending class. This combo really made my first semester tough in CS as I was questioning myself by the end of it and wondering if I had made the right choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to now I am finally in my senior year of college, needing to do an extra year to finish out my degree I went from the wanna be programmer who struggled with creating a simple c++ 
                program that would count elements in an array, to a senior CS major who currently works as a Python developer at a company as the sole programmer working on large projects and automating company wide tasks.
                I am truly proud of myself and the leaps and bounds I have made and equally as grateful for the failures and valleys I have gone through along the way. At one passionate
                the odds were not in my favor and my future as a CS was uncertain. I think because of my rather unorthodox and unique journey through computer science I have become the established CS major I am today.
