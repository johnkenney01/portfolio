        <p style="padding-left: 10px; text-indent: 30px; background-color: white; border-style: double;" >
            I first decided to go to Endicott College because of the ability to continue to play football. At the time 
            football was one of my main focuses. Having played for the majority of my life I was still very passionate at the 
            time and wanted to continue to be able to play the game I loved. I also entered Endicott as a sport management major, 
            I decided to go with sport management at first because with my main interests mainly residing in sports I figured it would 
            be smart to continue with something sports related.

        <p style="padding-left: 10px; text-indent: 30px; background-color: white; border-style: double;">
            After about a year and a half in the sport management program I realized this was not what I wanted to do for the rest 
            of my life as this was not something I found interest in. After doing a little internal reflection I decided to enter 
            the computer science program as a 2nd semester sophomore. From here I was able to make my way through the CS program learning
            way more than I had expected (not really knowing what to expect from the start) and found myself become exceedingly more passionate 
            about computer science with every passing semester. Yes it was hard, I was able to find that out very quickly. The challenge was something
            I embraced and welcomed. See more about my unique journey through computer science in the about me page or to see some of the projects I have done check out the projects page !

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px; text-indent: 30px; background-color: white; border-style: double; padding-bottom: 20px;">
            I have actually been to 3 seperate high schools in my 4 years. Having gone to BC High in Dorchester, Central Catholic in Lawrence, and finally 
            Wilmington High School. I decided to simply list Wilmington as my high school because this is where I ultimately ended up graduating from in 2018. 
            I went to 2 private schools for the first 3 years of high school in hopes of getting recognized for my football abilities, but when my 
            expectations were not met I deicded for myself that I would go to my hometown high school for my final year of school where I could play sports and go to
            school with my friends. Having the ability to fully express myself from an athletic standpoint I was able to draw some attention from schools 
            for track, but mainly football. Making the decision to go to Wilmington for my senior year is what I believe led me to choose Endicott. At Wilmington I was a 3 sport Varsity
            athlete and had the oppurtunity to graduate with some of my best friends.
