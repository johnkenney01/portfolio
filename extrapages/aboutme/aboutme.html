            <p class="who-i-am-p" >
                I am John Kenney, an aspiring software engineer currently working 
                towards a bachelor of science degree in computer science at Endicott 
                College. In my time at Endicott I have become very passionate about 
                programming and am fully immersing myself in the tech world more and 
                more each day. I have always been a sort of tech savvy person who 
                naturally is able to work with technology pretty well, having become 
                a CS major has only increased that skill ten fold. 
            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                I have always been a hard working individual who firmly believes that 
                with sheer determination and willpower one can accomplish anything they 
                want. I have dabbled in many different life experiences at this point
                in my life and want to continue to experience life and all it has to 
                offer. At 22 years of age I have played a lifetime’s worth of sports starting
                from preschool and ending at the collegiate level. I entered the workforce 
                at the young but ambitious age of 14, and I have been able to live away from 
                home for a number of years learning to become independent and self-sufficient. 
            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                I have always set high expectations for myself and even higher aspirations, 
                I understand that in order to reach these aspirations that the same level of 
                hard work and dedication needs to accompany any dream or goal. I have never 
                heard of a story where someone did not achieve their level of success because 
                they worked too hard, but I have heard people say they wished they had worked 
                harder or that they should have put more effort. If I set out for something 
                I never want to look back and say, should of, could of, would of because 
                I will leave it all out there. I fully understand and accept that failure 
                is an integral part of life and is necessary for growth. I have failed many 
                times and like to believe I have always learned from these failures. 
                As a soon to be graduate I know I have a lot to learn and am excited to learn from 
                people who have already walked a similar path to the one I am currently walking.
            </p>

            <h1 style="margin-left: 2%; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">My Computer Science Journey...</h1>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                I know everyone’s path in life is different. I know for sure that my college 
                experience was unique compared to the traditional college student. As I entered 
                college, football was the most important thing to me at the time. I was applying 
                to colleges based on their football programs as my main denominator. I also was 
                not too sure what I wanted to do academically, I had always presumed that sports 
                would continue to be the driving force in my life, whenever I had gotten to the 
                end of one football program (Elementary School, Middle School, High School etc.) 
                I had always gone on to the next level. I figured college would be no different, 
                as any semi-talented athlete would think. 
            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                I decided to enter college as a sport management major, I figured that with my love 
                for sports I might as well stay in something sports related. After an interesting 
                1.5 years in the sport management program and completing an internship with a sports 
                facility I started to doubt my decision. I went into winter break my sophomore year 
                really questioning what I wanted to do. After having a long internal reflection with 
                myself I was able to come to a decision on how to move forward. I had enrolled in 
                the computer science program. As I stated above I have always had large aspirations 
                and without any computer science experience prior and unknowingly enlisting myself 
                for a rude awakening, I started off my second semester sophomore year 
                (January, 2019) as a computer science major.
            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                I will be honest as I said…rude awakening for me. I knew CS was tech based, but 
                what I did not know was just how complex, complicated and how much depth was hiding 
                behind the title computer science. My first semester of CS had always coincided with 
                the major outbreak and start of the Covid pandemic. I had fully immersed myself into 
                a brand new world of concepts, terminologies, and ideas I had never been exposed to 
                before for those who know the CS field can attest to it being quite a unique area of 
                study. I struggled for sure, having to inevitably withdraw from my intro to 
                programming class. I vividly remember talking with my newly appointed advisor 
                explaining the tough reality I was faced with and my advisor providing his harsh 
                but warranted advice. “Maybe you should not have outright switched your major, 
                maybe you should have taken this class as an elective and felt the major out rather 
                than switching”. This was surely defeating for me as I now found myself between a 
                rock and a hard place. I knew I did not want to return to sport management, but I 
                also was not acclimating to CS as smoothly as I had originally intended.

            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                Fast forward to the following semester, I had re-taken my programming class this 
                time with a little more confidence than before and was able to complete the class. 
                Given the structure of the CS curriculum and layout of my timeline for graduation 
                I was going to have to take some classes required for my degree out of order, or 
                rather take some classes that are prerequisites for other classes while taking 
                those other classes at the same time. The odds were surely not in my favor, 
                but at this point I have decided that this was what I wanted to do and I was 
                going to do it. I was going to have to do at least one extra year as I switched 
                into CS 1.5 years into college and as not so great as that was I knew it was going 
                to have to happen if I wanted to do this.
            </p>
            <p class="who-i-am-p">
                Fast forward again to, for a lack of a better term, 2nd senior year. At this point 
                all my friends that I came in as freshmen with had graduated and moved on. Many 
                moved back home or away, and here I was. I had worked my way through the thick 
                of my degree having made exponential progress as a programmer through semesters 
                of different program classes, an internship that was essentially a full time 
                job the summer before. As the work itself continued to remain hard, the work was 
                more complex and much more useful. It was and still is at times hard to see the 
                progress I have made, but where I am today, a semester or so away from receiving 
                that degree in CS, graduating from college, entering an industry that is 
                statistically the fastest growing field in the country, I would say I have come 
                quite a long way from the kid who sat in a zoom call with his advisor, hearing 
                that maybe I had made the wrong decision, can confidently say I did not make the 
                wrong decision and would not change anything about the journey. The sleepless 
                nights, the grueling stress of midterms and programming assignments, the semester 
                long projects, the 40 hour internship work weeks…the lessons I learned and the 
                skills I learned are invaluable and I am forever grateful for that experience and 
                am eagerly seeking the next challenge in the next chapter of my life…
